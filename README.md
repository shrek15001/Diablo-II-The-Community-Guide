 About This Project

A Diablo II Community Guide that well be more up to date then any other guide, provides more detail and some Lore to go along with it.

Currently a work in progress and may take some time to complete before the pdf versions are released.

Currently looking for people who know the game to help out where they can.

We are working with Microsoft Office 2007 if you are intrested.

You can download microsoft office 2007 at http://getintopc.com/softwares/productivity/office_2007_download/

You may leave an email to join at snake87401@yahoo.com, snake87401@gmail.com, or at snake87401@live.com.

I well add you as a collaborator asap.
